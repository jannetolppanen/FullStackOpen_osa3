Everytime you change to a new computer, remember to add a .env file that has the mongodb uri and port.
Also change the address to the correct database if youre copy/pasting from atlasdb.

MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://janne:<password>@cluster0.qrchvix.mongodb.net/puhelinluettelo?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PORT=3001
